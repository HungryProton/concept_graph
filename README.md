# Concept Graph

This is a node based, procedural content creation tool.
Which means, you have a collection of nodes that you connect together to
create a complex result. You can see it as a form of visual scripting, but
for 3D models generation.


## Overview

The graph can be as simple ...

... or as complicated as you want ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52043844/82753149-d0791080-9dc3-11ea-8b76-035d7115ee55.png)


## Status

This tool is still a **work in progress**. Until it hits version 1.0, it is not
considered production ready and there's no guarantees the files generated with
this software will be compatible with later versions.


## Quick start

[Check out the wiki](https://github.com/concept-graph/concept-graph/wiki) for detailed explanations


## Known issues and roadmap

+ For a list of known issues, [head over the issue tracker](https://github.com/concept-graph/concept-graph/issues)
+ To track the work in progress and planned feature, [head over the project board](https://github.com/concept-graph/concept-graph/projects)

The **current focus** is to get the standalone version in a working state and **add a lot of documentation**.
Even though ConceptGraph doesn't have all of its planned features, we can't expect anyone to actually use this tool if nobody knows how to.


## Build from source
